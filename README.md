# Welcome to My CodSoft Internship Projects!

Hello there! My name is Pranav Thorat, and I'm excited to share with you the three programs I developed during my 4-week internship at CodSoft. These programs showcase my skills in C++ programming and problem-solving.


## 1. Random Number Guessing Game

### Description
In this program, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the correct number. The program provides feedback on whether the user's guess is too high or too low, and it keeps track of the number of attempts until the user guesses correctly. It's a fun and interactive way to test your luck and improve your guessing skills!

### How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your guesses when prompted.
3. Follow the feedback to adjust your guesses.
4. Continue until you guess the correct number.


## 2. Simple Calculator

### Description
This program is a user-friendly calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator, then displays the result of the calculation. The program also includes error handling to prevent division by zero and invalid operator inputs. It's a handy tool for quick calculations and a great way to practice using C++ for real-world applications.

### How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter two numbers when prompted.
3. Choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
4. View the result of the calculation.
5. Choose to perform another calculation or exit the program.


## 3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Description
In this classic game, two players (you and the computer) take turns placing their markers (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does. The program handles the game logic, including checking for winners and ties, and allows the user to play against the computer. It's a challenging game that requires strategic thinking and a bit of luck!

### How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. The game board will be displayed.
3. Enter a number (1-9) to place your marker in the corresponding spot on the board.
4. The computer will then make its move.
5. Continue taking turns until there is a winner or the game ends in a tie.
6. Choose to play again or exit the program.


## Conclusion

I hope you enjoy playing these programs as much as I enjoyed creating them. Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and even create your own variations. Happy coding!
